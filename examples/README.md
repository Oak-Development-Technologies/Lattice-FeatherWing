# Verilog Examples for thek Lattice FeatherWing

All examples can be built by modifying the `top.v` file. By default, it builds the RGB pwm example.

to build follwo the next steps:
1. run `make build` (make sure to have the OSS CAD Suite installed)

You can program this directly using the `make prog` command using an FT232H like ones sold by Adafruit.

Additionally, you can use [IcePython](https://github.com/skerr92/Oakdevtech_CircuitPython_IcePython) to program the FPGA via circuitpython.

More examples are coming in the future. If you wish to try other examples, checkout this [ice5lp4k examples library](https://github.com/skerr92/ice5lp4k_examples).
